              collected on the Site and is not intended to fully describe the
              privacy policies of Jessi Naff and Inner Wellness Counseling. It
              describes the information that we gather from you, how we use and
              disclose your information, and the steps we take to protect your

                Generally, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are
                or revealing any Personal Information (when we use the term
                “Personal Information,” we mean information that can be
                associated with a specific person and can be used to identify
                that person, such as name, e-mail address, mailing address,
                mobile phone number, age, gender, date of birth, as well as
                additional sensitive information such as your social security
                number, financial information, financial account information,
                and other similar types of information). If you do provide us
                with Personal Information, we will store and use that
                information in accordance with this Policy. For example, you may
                provide us with Personal Information when you fill out forms or
                fields on the Site and when you contact us or request
                information about us, this Site and our products or services
                (whether by email or other means).

              <li>
                We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or
                in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to take
                precautions against liability; to protect Jessi Naff from

              <li>
                We work with third party service providers to provide website
                development, hosting, data storage, maintenance, and other
                services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these third
                party service providers to complete their contractual
                obligations to us, these third parties may have access to or
                process your information.

            <h5><strong>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:</strong></h5>
            <p>
              Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
              For that reason, we do not allow children under 13 years of age to
              use the Site, we do not knowingly collect or maintain information
              from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the Site are
              directed to persons under 13 years of age. If you are under 13
              years of age, then please do not use or access the Site at any
              time or in any manner. If we learn that information has been
              collected through the Site from persons under 13 years of age and
              without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the
              appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent
              or guardian and discover that your child under 13 years of age has
              provided us with information, please alert us at
              <a href="contact.html"
                >https://innerwellnesscounseling.com/contact</a
              >
              to request that we delete the information from our systems.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Our Commitment to Data Security:</strong></h5>
            <p>
              We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that
              are designed to protect the integrity and security of your
              information; however, no security measures are perfect or
              impenetrable, so we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
              information you transmit to us through the Site, and you do so at
              your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may
              not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any
              of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We cannot
              control the actions of other users or other third parties with
              whom you may choose to share your information and therefore we
              cannot and do not guarantee that information you post through the
              Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not
              responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security
              measures contained on the Site. Even after removal, copies of
              information that you have posted may remain viewable in cached and
              archived pages or if other users have copied or stored such
              information. We retain information as long as it is reasonably
              necessary and relevant for our operations, and/or to comply with
              the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
              troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, or enforce
              our Terms or other agreements.

              the right to request that we refrain from processing your Personal
              Information. Please bear in mind that if you exercise such rights
              this may affect our ability to provide our products and services.

              applicable laws. Please note that it may take some time to process
              your request, consistent with applicable law.

              use and/or misuse of your information caused by those service

              <strong>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any
              time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we
              treat your information, including by placing a prominent notice on
              the Site or by sending you an email so that you can choose whether
              to continue using the Site. Material modifications are effective
              30 calendar days after our initial notification or upon your
              acceptance of the modified Terms. Immaterial modifications are
              effective upon posting of the updated Privacy Policy or Terms of
              Service on the Site. Please revisit this page periodically to stay
              aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. For the avoidance of

            <h5><strong>Do Not Track Disclosures</strong></h5>
            <p>
              Third parties such as advertising networks, analytics providers,
              and widget providers may collect information about your online
              activities over time and across different websites when you access
              or use our Services. Currently, various browsers offer a “Do Not
              Track” option, but there is no standard for how DNT should work on
              commercial websites. Due to lack of such standards, the Site does
              not respond to Do Not Track consumer browser settings.
