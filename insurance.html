            <p>
              In Massachusetts, I am qualified to provide mental health services
              as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor.
            </p>

            <p>
              My services may be reimbursable by your insurance company: I
              operate as an out of network provider, and will provide you with
              an itemized superbill on request. All sessions are initially paid
              in full out of pocket, and clients are responsible for
              understanding their benefit amounts and limits, and for submitting
              all claims.
            </p>

            <p>
              When calling your insurance company to find out if treatment will
              be reimbursed, here are a few questions that may be helpful to
              ask:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Do I have out of network benefits for psychotherapy / mental
                health / behavioral health?
              </li>
              <li>Do I have a deductible? How much is it?</li>
              <li>How many sessions are covered per year?</li>
              <li>
                What percentage of my bill will be covered after my deductible
                is met?
              </li>
              <li>
                For clients in Massachusetts: Does the insurance company provide
                coverage for services rendered by a Licensed Mental Health
                Counselor (LMHC)?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are the following CPT codes reimbursable? 90791(intake
                interview/diagnostic assessment,) 90834 (psychotherapy 45
                minutes,) 90837 (psychotherapy 60 minutes.)
              </li>
              <li>Are sessions delivered via teletherapy covered?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              One thing to consider when seeking reimbursement is that insurance
              companies do require a mental health diagnosis to be submitted
              with all claims. For some clients, a diagnosis can help to
              contextualize their challenges and clarify their needs. Others,
              however, may be uncomfortable with a diagnosis becoming part of
              their health record. Seeking reimbursement is a choice that each
              client is free to make for themselves. Should you require
              documentation, you are welcome to ask questions to better
              understand your diagnosis.
            </p>
            <h3>For All Other Clients</h3>
            <p>
              For clients outside of Massachusetts, Authentic Movement sessions,
              including movement and dialogue, are available. This service is a
              recreational personal growth activity and is not a substitution
              for healthcare provided by a licensed professional in your
              location of residence. This service includes the same standards of
              practice, record keeping, and confidentiality as maintained within
              my business, but does not include mental health diagnosis or
              treatment planning. This service is not reimbursable.
